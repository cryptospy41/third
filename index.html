            CryptoSpy is a modern crypto wallet tracking AI software that keeps track of 1.3 million wallets, tracks
            their every transaction, and creates alerts when specific conditions are met. It creates an alert 30 minutes
            before a pump or dump happens or when news hits the market.

            Some wallet addresses that belong to VIPs, like crypto trading platform CEOs, crypto influencers, and
            founders and owners of crypto coins, have a very high possibility of predicting a coin’s future direction.
            These people know when good or bad news is about to come out or have the capability to create a pump or dump
            themselves. By copying their trades, we can earn with smart money

            Time orders are orders placed by exchanges themselves to maintain the price of ETFs. These time orders are
            executed daily at 5:30 AM, 1:30 PM, and 9:30 PM. These orders can move the price by 2-5% in the future
            market. CryptoSpy has the capacity to find these time orders 30 minutes before they are executed, allowing
            us to front-run the exchanges and earn money
